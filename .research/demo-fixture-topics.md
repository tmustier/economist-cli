# Demo fixture topic plan (1900-1970)

Goal: curate ~100 demo fixtures from the archive that map to modern Economist sections. Use canonical RSS section keys (e.g., `finance-and-economics`, `united-states`). Existing fixtures already cover some topics; this list is the broader pool for selecting the remaining ~80-90.

The news from the United States is almost exclusively items of mobilisation. Many of these events are of local concern—the vast legal paraphernalia of bringing into operation emergency provisions long prepared. Many, again, are repetitions of what, on this side of the Atlantic, has long become familiar but was once new and strange. In every country, it appears, or at least in every democracy, ARP is not taken seriously until after the declaration of war, at the earliest. The alarms on the Atlantic Coast have died down; but California has been put in a state of emergency owing to repeated visits by enemy reconnaissance planes. The teething troubles of censorship are also apparent, and it is hoped that Mr Byron Price, the newly appointed Director of Censorship, will have more success in establishing a just balance of interest between the services and the public than his opposite numbers in England achieved for many months.

From the flood of other reports it is difficult to select for mention and impossible to append any comment. These, in barest outline, are some of the measures that have been taken: Both Houses of Congress have approved a supplementary defence appropriation of $8,244 million and the House has voted an additional supplementary appropriation of $10,000 million. The House, after some argument, has voted to extend the obligation of national service to all men from 21 to 44, and the Army is to be immediately expanded from its present 1,600,000 to 2,000,000.

Defence work is, wherever possible, to be on a basis of seven three-shift days. The Ford and General Motors plants have been put on this schedule at the positive request of the United Automobile Workers, and both the AFL and the CIO have announced a “no strike” agreement. ■

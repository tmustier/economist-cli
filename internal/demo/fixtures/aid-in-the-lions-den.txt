There were many who considered President Roosevelt’s budget for 1940, providing for federal spending of $9.2 billion, to be quite ruinous. There was concern and even consternation over Mr Truman’s budget for 1950 which involved $40.2 billion of federal spending. But now there is a budget which sets out to provide $51.2 billion for the military alone. In an election year the temptation to suggest that this is Mr Truman’s fault is sometimes irresistible, and the public mood has moved sharply toward demands for economy.

Nothing is clearer than that those who call for, and those who promise to effect, economies which offer some prospect of bringing down federal expenditures are now the most closely in tune with the public mood. Senator Douglas has urged Congress to squeeze $4 to $5 billion from the budget, while Senator Byrd has proposed an itemised alternative that would reduce the year’s spending to $76.8 billion, including a ruthless 5 per cent cut in military estimates.

This is the background against which the President’s request for $7.9 billion for foreign aid was submitted to Congress. The message and broadcast put a strong case in rough language, but Congress, faced with “terrific expenditures, back-breaking taxes, and inflation,” promises to take a hard look at all foreign spending. ■

The British public has recently been treated to a refreshing experience—the outbreak of commercial war in the market for household detergents. The pace has been set by those hardened competitors, Thomas Hedley and Company Ltd. and the Unilever group, battling for the share of the market which may be swung permanently from household soaps to synthetic detergents. Only Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Ltd., a newcomer in detergents in this country, has kept up with them. By a judicious combination of advertising and bargain offers most of the small manufacturers have been driven out of the detergents market. Now the giants, backed by the work of some of the best chemists in the country, are running sales campaigns with a prewar gusto.

The biggest effort is being made in London, where the very novelty of competition is bringing the industry added free publicity. For the country as a whole, the full exploitation of detergents has barely started. In 1948, it is estimated, some 25,000 tons of synthetic powders were sold, compared with 120,000 tons of soap flakes and powders. Total sales of domestic soaps of all kinds in 1948 were 277,000 tons, some 100,000 tons less than would have been consumed in a normal prewar year. Last year, sales of synthetics rose to about 45,000 tons as two of today’s leading brands came into full production.

Technical knowledge about detergents has made great strides, but it is by no means complete. The active agents of synthetic detergents have been greatly improved but knowledge of how they loosen dirt and then hold it in suspension is still incomplete. It is not easy to prepare a detergent which combines these two properties as effectively as they are combined in soap, and slight changes in a detergent’s formula can cause considerable changes in its properties. ■

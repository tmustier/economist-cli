In a few months, jet airliners will begin regular services across the Atlantic; the sketches accompanying this article show some of their distinguishing features. There are five of these airliners; in descending order of size and range, two are American, one is British, one Russian and one French. Only one, the Russian, is actually in service and beginning to make increasingly numerous appearances in western European capitals. Of the rest, an early version of the Boeing 707 will start carrying passengers across the North Atlantic in October, followed in a matter of weeks by the de Havilland Comet IV. The French Caravelle is expected to come into service inside Europe soon after Christmas and the American Douglas DC 8 may appear on the North Atlantic at the end of 1959.

These five represent a completely new type of airliner, one that combines the structural problems of a fast fighter with the economic problems of a civil transport. As in first attempts, their designs are relatively crude and easy to fault. The Vickers VC 10 jet airliner which the British Overseas Airways Corporation should get in six years’ time, or the de Havilland 121 airliner which British European Airways will have around the same date, belong to a second generation of jets, more refined machines that should not be compared with those now going into service.

The world’s first short-lived jet airliner service was opened by the Comet 1 in 1952 and ended abruptly two years later when metal fatigue split open two aircraft in quick succession. The Comet accidents made it plain to the world that there were no short cuts to economical jet design, such as using the thinnest, lightest skin to keep down total weight. To protect them from metal fatigue at high altitude, jet airliners were going to need stiff and heavy skins. From such considerations, it became clear that these aircraft were only going to pay if they could carry on average 100 or more passengers. ■

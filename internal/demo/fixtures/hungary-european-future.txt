The Hungarian patriots suffered such a violent change of fortune, from apparent victory to crushing defeat, that it is hard to know whether they were really doomed from the start. For the Russians, the sticking point probably came when Mr Nagy announced his country’s neutrality and its desire to get rid of the Red Army. His formation two days later of what seems to have been intended to be a genuine multi-party government took place after Soviet reinforcements had begun to roll into Hungary. But whether the earlier Soviet offer to discuss withdrawing troops was genuine or only a feint to gain time, whether the change of policy, if such there was, was advocated by the whole Soviet leadership or whether it was imposed by the Army—the answers to these questions remain obscure.

So does the future of Hungary. The new prime minister, Mr Janos Kadar, was imprisoned by Rakosi as a potential Titoist in 1951, although since his release about two years ago he seems to have kept his “national communism” within discreet bounds. His appointment, his programme of very moderate reforms and the official denunciations of both “the Rakosi clique” and of Mr Nagy all suggest that Moscow will try to damp down popular discontent while maintaining its iron grip on the country, by introducing a very carefully controlled Gomulka-type regime.

This experiment is unlikely to succeed. Savage repression—and the meagre reports coming out of Hungary suggest that this is no exaggeration—and the bitter resentment of the oppressed will not produce a propitious climate for a “liberalised” communist regime; and even if the government makes a genuine attempt to overcome the country’s economic plight and raise living standards, its efforts will be seriously hampered by the non-co-operation, and even the passive resistance, of the workers. Large-scale Russian help, if it is forthcoming, may help the regime, but it will not make it popular. ■

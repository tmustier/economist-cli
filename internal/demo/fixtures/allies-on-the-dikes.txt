Britain can recall in recent history nothing like the furious energy, sympathy and spirit of service called forth in Europe and outside by the floods in Holland. Civilians and fighting men of the western countries have rallied to help their stricken ally with an array of materials, machines and technical resources almost as impressive as the fury of the North Sea. The services of all these “foreigners,” if the word can be used of the men who worked so hard and risked their lives for the Dutch, have been important not only for their achievement in rescue and defence against the sea; they have also done wonders in strengthening the morale of thousands of Dutch volunteers working day and night at the dikes.

Britain sent army engineers and a number of helicopters which were invaluable in rescuing people from inaccessible spots. The motorship Fleetwood brought rubber boats and other supplies. The Dutch Ambassador in London was offered large fishing boats, fully equipped and manned. The Canadians in Germany sent amphibious craft and aircraft. Two battalions of French engineers arrived with their amphibious equipment. Belgium, itself suffering severely from floods, managed to send engineers and aircraft and opened its borders to people and goods coming from Zeeland. The Americans, above all, seemed to find in the emergency a foe worthy of their skill and seemingly inexhaustible resources.

Other offers of help in money, goods and hospitality have been far too numerous to be set down in full. In about thirty countries of the free world, ranging from neighbouring Belgium to South America, Burma and Indonesia, relief collections are being made. Western Germany sent large Rhine barges loaded with clothing, shoes, medicines and drugs, and small boats came from Hamburg. A number of towns in the United States, Canada and Western Germany have offered to “adopt” stricken Dutch municipalities. ■

The verdict of the House of Commons on Mr Churchill’s visit to Washington has been postponed, but at least the charge brought against him by the Opposition has been reduced. When the foreign affairs debate is resumed, he will face not a vote of censure on policy in the Far East but a mild rebuke for having talked too winningly to Congress. The Labour party now says that he did not tell Congress the truth about British policy; a careful comparison between what Mr Churchill said to Congress and what he said to the House revealed no important discrepancy that could not be explained by the need to show tact in addressing the legislature of the United States.

The pause in Parliament can be used to reconsider realities in the Far East. There are two basic matters on which the mind of the public seems confused: a question of tactics and, by far the graver, a question of national interest. To put the first quite crudely: what noises should the Chinese Communists hear from this country—soothing or minatory noises? One would have thought there was cause for anger with the men behind a policy which has started a costly war, caused loss to millions of homes, disrupted economic life and kept all Asia in suspense.

Instead it is pretended by a section of opinion that we are not really at war with China, that defensive action by the United Nations should remain a sideshow, and that the British must steer a course between unfriendly Chinese and friendly Americans. The effect in the Communist world is clear for all to see: it means that the Americans and British can be divided, and that it is safe to wage against the West a long war of attrition and nerves. ■

The short-range objective of the Budget, and especially of the simultaneous dramatic rise in Bank rate, was to arrest the speculative pressure against sterling and to turn the short-run psychological factors to its advantage. The urgency of such stop-gap relief was starkly demonstrated by the ominously low level to which the gold and dollar reserve had fallen by the end of February and the frightening rate at which it was being encroached upon. Judged by this criterion of reviving confidence, how far are the Budget and the Bank rate proving effective?

The first statistical measure will become available toward the end of next week, when the figures for the gold and dollar reserve at the end of March are announced. Any verdict based on these figures will be inconclusive; they will not show any reflection of the fundamental effects that the Government expects to flow from the decisions announced on budget-day. The relief to Britain’s current balance of payments from the rise in money rates and the latest cut in non-sterling imports cannot begin to show itself for some time.

In this crucial phase of the battle for sterling, before the fundamental measures can show their full worth, psychological influences have a great part to play. Foreign opinion has been impressed by the rise in Bank rate and reassured by the cut in food subsidies and concessions in direct taxation, and it is hoped that their effect will quickly be reflected in a demand for sterling and some consequent accretion of gold and dollars to the reserve. ■

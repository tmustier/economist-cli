The budget plays such an important part in the Soviet economy that if the Russians were to reveal their detailed accounts they could certainly produce an illuminating tableau économique of the Soviet Union. This is probably the chief reason why the veil of secrecy surrounding the budget figures is raised so reluctantly. The recent budgetary session of the Supreme Council was no exception; the Minister of Finance, Mr Zverev, was rather more reticent than usual. He reviewed briefly the accounts for 1950 and, incompletely, for 1951 before announcing the estimates for 1952. The debate over the new budget provided few additional clues, and the Supreme Council limited its task to raising the estimated revenue and surplus by another 1,100 million roubles.

Even this limited information throws some light on the trends of the Soviet economy. The rise in Soviet defence spending was analysed last week: direct defence expenditure rose by over 16 per cent in 1951 and is scheduled to increase by nearly 19 per cent in the current year. What is the impact of this growing cold-war burden on the economy as a whole, and how is the burden apportioned between the various sectors?

The Russian planners still claim scope for rapid expansion; in 1951 national income was said to rise by 12 per cent and the same rhythm is expected to continue. Defence outlays are rising faster than the national income, yet the other branches of the economy have not begun to decline in absolute terms; they have increased at a declining rate, taking a smaller slice of a bigger national cake. The social and cultural services appear the chief relative victims of the defence effort, while consumption is expected to feel the weight in the current year. ■

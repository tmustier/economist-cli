Recent change in the supreme command and its prompt swing toward monetary policy has had the effect of putting the banks, with their battalions of branch managers and advances controllers, right into the front line of the battle against inflation. What the commanders in the field think about the new policy, and what they are prepared to say about the way in which it has been applied so far, may therefore supply significant indications about its working in future. This changing role of the banks makes the latest of the annual series of chairmen’s statements of more than usual interest. As in the past, their comments range widely over the whole course of the battle and its underlying strategy; but it is upon that part of the line in which they are now directly engaged that their views most deserve scrutiny.

To the first of these questions the bankers give a clear answer. They all do approve. Lest anyone should still suppose this attitude to be rooted in narrow self-interest, it should be noted in passing that most of them specifically reaffirm the rebuttal of the charge that the change of policy would put “millions of pounds” into the pockets of bank shareholders. They point out that the prospective addition to their net earnings from interest receipts and payments that may accrue over a full year, and will be secured partly because of a loss of liquidity, is much less than the “book” loss already experienced on investments. The new offensive against inflation must be painful; and inevitably those in the front line have suffered first, and to the extent of “tens of millions” of depreciation, as Lord Balfour of Burleigh candidly admitted. ■

The new central government of China set up in Peking has received immediate diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union and from its satellites. It is a strange and wonderful creation, which is certainly intended to conceal rather than to display the current reality of Communist China. There has been nothing so simple as the formation of a cabinet, with a distribution of portfolios among leading political personalities on the side of the new People’s Republic. The large, amorphous assembly convoked by the Communists, the so-called People’s Political Consultative Conference, has elected a People’s Government Council of 63 members and a National Committee of the People’s Democratic Front of 180 members.

The Government Council, which has Mao Tse-tung as chairman, has appointed Chou En-lai as Premier of State Administration and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mao Tse-tung as chairman of the People’s Revolutionary Military Council. It has also appointed heads of the new supreme people’s court and the procurator-general’s office; but apparently, as in the Kuomintang system, there will be no cabinet of ministers in control of all branches of state activity.

This complicated system is, however, admirably suited to provide the appearance, without the substance, of a broadly-based coalition government. Three out of the six vice-chairmen of the Government Council are non-Communists, and among ordinary members of the Council are to be found more than one leading Chinese capitalist. It was foreseen that the Communists would make a good show of coalition politics, when it came to setting up a formal government, partly in order to impress foreign opinion with their liberality, partly to gain maximum support from middle-of-the-road and opportunist political elements within China during the period before they have consolidated their power. ■

One great difference between prewar and postwar Russia is the impression of political stability presented by the Soviet regime since the last war. With the purge of the generals in 1938, that phase came to an end. All potential competitors had been eliminated and Stalin reigned supreme. Yet with one notable exception, none of the major Soviet political figures has been removed from the stage since the war except by death.

The exception is Nicolai A. Voznessensky, a brilliant young economist who, having been Russia’s chief planner in wartime and the following three years, was, in March 1949, suddenly and mysteriously dismissed from his posts as vice-premier, head of the Planning Commission and member of the Politbureau. Beyond this official demotion nothing else was disclosed at the time. But a short time ago the affair was raked up again by the new propaganda chief, Mikhail Suslov, who thus officially acknowledged Voznessensky’s disgrace and simultaneously revealed that it had been accompanied by a major reshuffle among Soviet economists.

The incident has thus been formally closed; yet it shows that a strange struggle must be going on beneath the smooth monolithic surface of Soviet politics. The editor of Izvestia must have known that Fedosseyev had been attacked by the Central Committee and that he was in disgrace, yet Suslov’s sudden rebuff implies that the party is dissatisfied with the over-liberal treatment of disgraced economists. ■

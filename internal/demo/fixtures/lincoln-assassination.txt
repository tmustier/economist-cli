Vast, however, as are the difficulties which lie before the Americans ere their country can again assume a normal and settled condition, it cannot be denied that they are applying themselves to their work with their usual earnestness and energy, and we have no doubt they will accomplish it far more speedily than any other nation could do. Their power of recovery is absolutely wonderful.

Scarcely six months have elapsed since the virtual termination of the war by Lee's surrender, and of that time much was unavoidably lost by the transfer of supreme power into fresh hands in consequence of Lincoln's assassination and Mr Johnston's accession to the Presidential throne. Yet in those few months how much has been effected. A large proportion of the troops have been disbanded; hundreds of vessels have been taken out of commission and laid up in ordinary; the work of reconstruction has already made considerable progress in several of the Southern States as far as mere political arrangements go; and industry is beginning to raise its head by degrees in some of the districts.

In a couple of years, we have little doubt, the external appearance of things throughout the Union will be nearly what it was before the war. Below all this there will, of course, be traceable the scars of wounds that can never be altogether healed; and also, we would hope, the net result of lessons which will never be forgotten. ■

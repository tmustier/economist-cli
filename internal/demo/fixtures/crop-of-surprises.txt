This year’s farm price settlement has produced quite a crop of surprises. The Government has run away from its declared intention of cutting the cost of the agricultural subsidies, and has instead increased by £25 million the value of its guarantees to farmers. Secondly, it has discriminated drastically between different products in the allocation of its aid. Finally, as a consequence of this discrimination, the farmers’ unions have flatly repudiated the final price settlement for the first time in the history of these annual reviews.

The intention to cut aid to agriculture was vitiated by a rise in farming costs equivalent to £35 million a year for the commodities covered by the review; leniency may also have been encouraged by the fact that this year’s subsidy bill—at about £215 million—is going to be lower than expected. But the familiar argument that a redistribution of aid would torpedo farmers’ confidence, and the Government’s political standing in the countryside, has once again caused agriculture to be exempted from the general rule of national economy.

Having given farmers their twenty-five million pounds of flesh, Mr Heathcoat Amory has tried to see that the nation gets value for it. The most economical savings of foreign exchange are to be had by persuading farmers to grow more fodder and by developing home production of beef and mutton. Accordingly, the Minister has increased the prices of oats, barley, fat sheep, and fat cattle—while cutting the expensive wheat subsidy and taking another thin rasher off the large pig subsidy. To stimulate productivity the fertiliser subsidy has been raised, and to improve quality a bonus will be paid on best-grade bacon pigs. ■

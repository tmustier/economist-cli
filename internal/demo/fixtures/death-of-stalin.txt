With the passing of Stalin from the seat of supreme power in Russia the world is a healthier but not a safer place. It is healthier for the revelation that even the deity of the Communist Party is mortal; but it is no safer for the revelation that the mind and will of the master are crippled. The evil that men do lives after them, and a tyranny may be more dangerous, more irresponsible, when the man who created it has gone from the scene. There is, in fact, no knowing what may happen in the internal affairs and foreign policy of the Soviet Union without the shrewd, cautious and flexible judgment of Stalin.

So long as he had the last word, it was not impossible to judge with reasonable accuracy the course of Soviet foreign policy in most issues; the study of Stalin was a legitimate substitute for the study of too scanty intelligence about Russia. From his style and manner, developed through the years, could be judged some of the tensions and rivalries around him. It was certain that his orders would be obeyed; there was no appeal from his decision; only he could pronounce on the great questions of peace and war. He learnt from mistakes. His way of thinking was brutal, cynical, even mean; but it was seldom unaccountable.

If this is really the end of Joseph Vissarionovich Djugashvili as a ruler, then there has probably been heard already the cry "Stalin is dead, long live Stalinism." The regime and the doctrine must be carried on, if only because the successors, whoever they may be, know no better. It is the cautious, conservative advice of an ageing generalissimo, good enough in its way; but is it specific enough to enable his heirs to steer between left-wing impatience and right-wing caution? If not— and history is full of bloody disputes over the testaments of great men—then in both the foreign and domestic policies of the Soviet Union there is the danger of sudden changes and unpredictable attitudes. ■

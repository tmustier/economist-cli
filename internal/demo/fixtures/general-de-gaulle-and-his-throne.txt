Future historians who have to estimate the place in history of General de Gaulle will agree that the peculiar vigour of his mind was one of his main characteristics. They will be divided between those who think it was his principal merit and those who consider it reduced his usefulness to almost nothing. The General belongs to the small class who require no moral support to believe in their own reasoning. His first speech broadcast by the BBC on June 18, 1940, is a short statement of a staff officer’s estimate of a strategic situation whose conclusion was that all his superior officers were wrong.

Throughout his career he has seen the necessity of united action, but the union is apt to become all the more difficult because of the mathematical violence with which he conceives it. France, one sentient individual person, constantly replaces in his thought the reality of the French people consisting of an infinite variety of men and women. Such emphasis on alliance was a curious prelude to four years of battle with France’s allies, and it has limited his ability to apply even the truths he sees.

In the autumn of 1947, at the head of his newly formed French People’s Rally, he more than anyone else was responsible for slowing the gradual Communist conquest of French cities. Yet the latest turn of the wheel showed the revolt of sworn supporters determined to vote for M. Pinay, and one could only wonder whether it was the perverted minds of his political enemies or the refusal of Gaullist deputies to accept his assessment of the situation that most troubled him. The break-up of the Rally may make it easier to run the Fourth Republic, but it would also deprive the country of the only non-Communist party not run by a headless committee. ■

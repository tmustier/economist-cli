By virtue of his present position and of his long association with nuclear research, Sir John Cockcroft, the director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, is highly qualified to assess the future development of atomic power. In his recent Romanes lecture, he declared that the development of nuclear energy from uranium is more difficult than had been supposed in the first flush of postwar enthusiasm. We shall not be able to predict its future with any certainty until we have built experimental power producers and obtained experience by their operation.

This process will take at least ten years. Sir John admits the obvious attraction of obtaining the same energy from one ton of uranium as from 3,000,000 tons of coal. But if industrial countries are to depend in future on nuclear reactors for their power they must first be certain that fuel reserves will suffice for centuries ahead. In all countries, concentrated deposits of uranium are limited, but millions of tons are present in various minerals in concentrations of one per cent or less. The first problem is to find an economic method of extracting low-grade uranium ores.

High costs of extraction demand that as much of the uranium as possible should be consumed. The present type of pile obtains heat only from the fission of U235 and discards the non-fissile U238, which is 140 times more plentiful. Sir John considers a radically different type of atomic pile, the “breeder reactor,” essential for power production. It would use some of the neutrons released during the fission of U235 to turn the normally non-fissile materials U238 and thorium into fissile materials. In theory, this principle offers a means of using a very large proportion of the uranium metal as fuel. ■

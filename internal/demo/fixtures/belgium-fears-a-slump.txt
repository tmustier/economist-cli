Clear signs that economic activity in Belgium is slowing down have been appearing since the beginning of the year. The result must be to force Belgium increasingly into co-operation with the other members of Nato with inevitable effects on the external economic policy of the country. Since the Lisbon conference the Belgians have shown their willingness in principle to increase their defence effort, and to adopt in part the recommendations of the Three Wise Men, by their proposal to grant a loan of $20 million to Europe and to make purchases in EPU countries to the amount of $40 million in the shape of reserves of weapons and munitions for the Belgian army. Belgium was also prepared to agree to a loan of $100 million to France within the framework of the EPU, but this was turned down by the American authorities.

Belgium was encouraged to make these concessions largely by its anxiety over the future of its exports. But the avoidance of any further increase in the defence effort and an undiminishing distrust for international commitments remain as the central preoccupations of both government and public opinion. Belgium, in fact, is torn between its traditional policies of monetary restriction at home and minimum co-operation abroad on the one hand, and, on the other, the necessity of some economic expansion at home and collaboration in Europe forced on it by the dangers of severe recession. This is the background to the rumours, which started at Lisbon, of a Belgian plan for an international economic conference under the auspices of Nato, with the object of combating the dangers of a world economic crisis. ■

To tell simple economic truths to trade union leaders may, as Mr Gaitskell appears to think, be provocative. But it can also be singularly effective. Although the situation on the labour front remains complicated and delicate, the prospects for avoiding wage inflation have visibly improved in the past few days. The first welcome development came when the TUC moved quickly to persuade Mr Cousins not to widen the bus struggle into a petrol and power strike. On the same Thursday the mineworkers’ executive accepted an arbitration award that gave their members no wage increase this year. If a settlement could be reached with the London busmen without breaking the main wages line, the Government might win acceptance of a reasonably non-inflationary pattern of wage increases.

In these circumstances, there was a sound case for the peace formula which Mr Macmillan suggested that London Transport should offer to Mr Cousins. But most of the concessions had already been offered, and Mr Cousins felt able to stand by his familiar tactic of demanding the last little bit more. He asked for a token increase of 4s. a week for his country busmen, and found its refusal beyond comprehension. There could be no more damning proof than his own arithmetic that this strike was no longer a matter of protecting standards of living; it was now purely a matter of safeguarding what he called “dignity and honour,” a euphemism for saving his own personal face. The odd man is still out. ■

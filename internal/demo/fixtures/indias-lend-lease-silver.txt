Arrangements have been put in hand to begin the gigantic task of extracting the silver from demonetised rupee coins that are being steadily replaced by nickel tokens. A refinery is being set up in India to handle this job and the constructional work has been entrusted to a British engineering firm. The problem of refining coin of 50-50 fineness—the bulk of the existing silver coinage in India—presents considerable technical difficulty, as has been discovered in Britain by Rothschild’s refinery, which is handling the bulk of the silver coins withdrawn from circulation and replaced by cupro-nickel tokens.

In India, as in Britain, the main objective of the demonetisation of silver coins is to provide sufficient silver with which to repay the metal that was provided under lend-lease by the United States during the war. Unlike the other parts of the lend-lease accounts for which the slate was cleaned at the end of hostilities, this silver has to be repaid in kind within five years after the official termination of the war—a date incidentally that has not yet been established. The amount owing by the United Kingdom is 88,100,000 ounces and by India 226,000,000 ounces. The demonetisation of rupee coins is expected to produce 300,000,000 ounces of pure silver and the bulk of this is thus earmarked for repayment to the United States. ■

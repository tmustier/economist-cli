In this confused decade, when Senator Taft and Mr Henry Wallace can share the same page of the New York Times to explain why they are Liberals, and when Stalin can lament the passing of Liberalism and the West’s betrayal of the freedom of the individual, it is encouraging to find in Europe a group of Liberal politicians who share a common purpose, and who claim to be exercising an increasing influence on European affairs. That, at any rate, was the lesson Senator Roger Motz of Belgium drew from the recent Liberal International Congress in Strasbourg. It was, he said, now clear that a European Liberal party was in the process of being born, and that it would find its proper field of operations in the new European institutions. Who are these “Liberals” of whom Senator Motz was speaking? And by what right do they so describe themselves? The best yardstick is recognition by the Liberal International.

Even a casual survey shows that these parties achieve no very high common denominator in their domestic policies. It is, however, hardly to be expected that they should, since Liberalism is not a dogma to be followed rigidly in all situations, but a body of principles which, when applied to the varying conditions of Europe, produces widely differing results. In foreign policy, however, they are discovering an identity of purpose surprising even to themselves, and in the institutions of Strasbourg and Luxemburg agreement is beginning to flower into co-operation. ■

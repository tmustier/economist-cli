Samuel Johnson observed that nothing so concentrates a man’s mind as the knowledge that he is to be hanged in a fortnight. Something of this mood seems to have stirred the conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers that ended last Monday. Certainly, it is a mortal crisis that now confronts the sterling area; if it is to be saved, something more than emergency stop-gap operations of the 1947 and 1949 kind are needed. Danger has clearly been the dominant motif and propellant of the conference, and the response of the Finance Ministers to it has been more realistic and vigorous than at any previous conference of this kind. The meetings have certainly been successful—within the limitations of authority and executive power by which such conferences are inevitably bound.

But it will take more than last Monday’s communiqué, despite all its resounding words, to overcome the perils that now stalk the sterling area. Agreement may have been reached about the character of the measures that should be taken to protect and rebuild the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area and to end the chronic deficits that most of the leading members of the club have been prodigally running in their overseas payments accounts. It remains for the separate and autonomous countries represented at the conference to translate these general heads of agreement into action and it is not yet clear that their endowment of political courage and economic wisdom is sufficient for these grim tasks. The sterling area can survive on two conditions only. ■

While the debate on policy between the Truman Administration and General MacArthur goes on before a Congressional Committee, the United Nations forces in Korea are fighting a war as tough and bitter as any of modern times. The Chinese Communists’ will to gain decisive victory is apparently still unimpaired, and their plan seems to be to launch a series of offensives in the hope of breaking through the Allied lines or wearing down the resistance of General van Fleet’s army. The first blow was parried and ended in an Allied success, but not until after the Allied line had been severely hammered.

At the moment there is a lull, and the member nations’ forces can claim considerable success in repelling a mass onslaught on their line. In this action the Gloucester Regiment suffered heavy losses in its gallant stand on Hill 235, which symbolised the very nature of this strange campaign. This great action of a British unit in the common cause has been recognised by a United States Presidential unit citation which declared that the “indomitable spirit and heroism of the famous Gloucestershire battalion will long be remembered as an outstanding example of courage and determination by all freedom-loving people.” ■

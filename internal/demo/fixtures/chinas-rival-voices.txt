The Chinese Communists have shown political wisdom in waiting until they have definitely gained control of the greater part of China before making their claim to recognition as its legal government; but they have now made the move in good time to counter the Nationalist Chinese delegation’s appeal against the Soviet Government in the Assembly. Now that the Soviet bloc has transferred diplomatic recognition to the Communist regime, it can challenge the right of Dr Tsiang to speak for China; and western nations which are considering the transfer of recognition find it embarrassing at this moment to sustain him in a right which they still formally acknowledge.

Their confusion was reflected in the proceedings of the Assembly’s committee which, after a voting tie on Dr Tsiang’s request for his appeal to be treated as urgent, put it fifth on the agenda. This is expected to mean that it cannot come before the Assembly before the middle of November, by which time Britain, the United States and France may have made up their minds to which of China’s megaphones they will officially listen—the one which says that Russia has promoted the disruption of China or the one which says that Russia is China’s only true friend.

The situation in the United Nations would be comic if it were not so serious, for the Charter does not provide any procedure for depriving a delegation once duly seated of its right to represent the country which sent it. If the principles to be followed are those governing admission of new members of the United Nations, it is even arguable that the delegate of a permanent member of the Security Council with the right of veto can legally prohibit his own removal. No doubt, however, the view will be taken that on this occasion at any rate the veto does not apply, and that the Security Council can by a majority vote place a Chinese Communist in Dr Tsiang’s seat. ■

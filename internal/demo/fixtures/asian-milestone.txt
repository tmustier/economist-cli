The birth of a sovereign Federation of Malaya ends the age of west European rule on the Asian mainland. That age began when the venturers who had acquired trading posts, “factories” and strongholds on Asia’s coasts and offshore islands were led on to take control of great tracts of territory. Long content with mastery of the sea, embroiled in continental affairs only when these threatened their commercial interests, they assumed—sometimes eagerly, sometimes with reluctance—the new role of administrators and rulers. British India was their most spectacular creation; but in time the flags of the maritime European powers flew from Palestine to Tonking.

It is now ten years since the decisive event in their great retreat, the British withdrawal from India. There followed the emancipation of Burma and Ceylon, and the convulsive end of Dutch rule in the Indies and of French rule in Indo-China. Now Malayan independence brings the wheel full circle. There remain some modern equivalents of the seventeenth-century factories: the young and bustling entrepots of Hongkong and Singapore, the decayed relics at Goa and Macao. But these are coastal pinpoints.

The only European power that still rules in mainland Asia is Russia, whose empire, reaching out to the Sea of Japan and the Hindu Kush, embraces between thirty and forty million Moslems and Mongols. Malaya’s sovereignty is thus a milestone both on its own road and on that of Asia. But what of the road ahead? ■

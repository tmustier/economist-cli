The second week’s holiday for the miners this year may cost the National Coal Board four million tons of coal. If the miners were to stop working on Saturdays, another ten million tons would be lost—which would put an end to coal exports this year and probably mean a fuel crisis next winter. The miners will take their holiday. In all probability, they will not stop weekend working; but the bare possibility has become a seasonable bogeyman to haunt Hobart House in the long winter evenings. These evenings, this winter, have been sharply colder; and Britain, once again, has begun to burn more coal than a year before.

Output in 1953, the board hopes, should make up the coal lost through the extra holiday, with something to spare. Last year’s performance was not quite as disappointing as the bare figures would suggest. Of the 22,000 additional workers gained during 1952, an unusual proportion were juveniles; this partly explains the limited influence that successful recruiting had on output in the short term, but it signifies a useful improvement in the age balance of mining manpower. Today, the industry puts its needs at no more than 10,000-12,000 extra workers, in Yorkshire, the Midlands and South Wales. ■

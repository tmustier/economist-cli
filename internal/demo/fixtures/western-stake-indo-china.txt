Perhaps it is only the regular student of foreign affairs who fully admits that the battle for Europe could be lost on the rice fields of Asia. Yet, while western rearmament proceeds, the building up of a situation of strength in the Orient lags, by contrast, seriously behind. The Russians may have turned their backs on Europe, admitting, for the moment, failure. Instead the cause of Communism is being urgently pressed forward in the Far East, by war in Korea, Indo-China, Malaya and Burma and by fervid, calculating propaganda elsewhere. But, even though, in Mr Churchill’s words, the centre of gravity lies in Europe, if the Russians and the Chinese were to win in Asia, there could be no saying where the chain reaction would end.

The real beginning of this potential chain is in Indo-China rather than Korea. Apart from the scale of the Korean war, which increases the danger of its spreading, Indo-China is strategically the more important. The Paris meeting of the Atlantic Council last month, however, placed on record for the first time the fact that the war in Indo-China is a prime concern of the whole Atlantic community. It is the first time that Nato has formally stretched an arm outside the European theatre to the other side of the world, and it emphasises in an unprecedented way the identity of the problems of defence in Europe and the Far East.

What the declaration does not do is to say how this struggle can be brought to a successful end. It is a strange dispensation that the French, a people still suffering from their mauling in the last two great wars, should hold the keys of the fortress in both West and East at the same time. For the problem of Indo-China, like that of West European defence, is in large part the problem of France. ■
